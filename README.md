# Blog
My, andreasl's blog about engineering-related topics.

This `jekyll`-based blog contains articles about engineering-related topics I have written over
time.
Find it on GitHub pages at https://langenhagen.github.io/blog/.


## Prerequisites
You need `ruby`, possibly installed with `rbenv`.
You also need `jekyll`. See: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/.


## Local Usage
Run locally with:
```bash
jekyll serve --baseurl ""
```

You should visit the blog then according to your `jekyll` installation on `localhost:4000`.
