I currently read a blog post by Kate Matsudaira at ACM Queue. The blog post has the headline: "The
Evolution of Management - Transitioning up the ladder". Generally - tldr, it's about the importance of
alignment, communication, mentoring, letting go of details and looking into the further future when
climbing up the ladder of management.

Kate wrote one phrase I like to recite:
> Set goals that are continually growing.

Another phrase struck me:
> Create a culture that places value on doing work that matters and gets the team's goals done, not
> on being the busiest or smartest or loudest person in the room.

It struck me, becauce I sometimes feel like one of the busiest people in the room. Then again, I
really like doing my work and oftentimes see the necessicity and ways to improve on our status quo.
I wish to be in an environment that has its foundations nicely laid out and its processes lean and
nicely under control.

Initial entry. I am happy to have a versioned, easy to maintain markdown blog for public use.
I will use it in my day-to-day work for NDA-compatible things I consider worth sharing with the
public. I will come up with a mechanism to automatically publish the blog several times a day, e.g.
via a cronjob.
