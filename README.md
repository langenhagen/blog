I currently read a blog post by Kate Matsudaira at acm queue. The blog post has the headline: "The
Evolution of Management - Transitioning up the ladder". Generally, it's about the importance of
alignment, communication and letting go of details when climbing up the ladder of management. Kate
wrote one phrase I like to recite:
> Set goals that are continually growing.

The blog entry can be read here: https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3350548

Initial entry. I am happy to have a versioned, easy to maintain markdown blog for public use.
I will use it in my day-to-day work for NDA-compatible things I consider worth sharing with the
public. I will come up with a mechanism to automatically publish the blog several times a day, e.g.
via a cronjob.
