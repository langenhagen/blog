# Glassdoor & Kununu Review for Momox
Draft of my company's review I inted to put onto Glassdoor & Kununu. Please don't share.

I applied as a Sr. Python Engineer in Summer 2020. The 2 stage interview process was easy, suspiciously easy in hindsight. One cultural interview and one technical interview. They asked some basics in Python and a bit of SQL. One of the interviewees was only 1 months at Momox. I found that suspicious, but shrugged it off. I wanted the job. The lead dev, more like a direct manager for sev, teams and that I never saw writing code, let on that they use Google Cloud, Django, Domain Driven Design and Event sourced system. They said the company's focus in the upcoming year is development into the sector "fashion". The tasks within the first year should be to own a system that surpasses a prototype that they put live. Got an offer on the next day. I said yes.

I started together with another guy, pretty decent dude, during Corona times. One guy from the team welcomed us at the office, the rest of the team was remote. Me and the other starter quickly realized that the whole thing was pretty amateurish. No git commit messages, empty Jira tickets or tickets saying X then the assignees doing something totally different. Also bad code, second worst code I ever saw, in fact, lots of fluff, indirectness, obfuscations and more superfluous logic than I ever saw anywhere else. No documentation, neither in the code, nor in the tickets or Confluence. The biggest problem was the permanently failing production system. Our clients worked until night and often on Saturdays. Therefore, we had an on-call phone duty. Think: work at night or on Saturday. The number of blocker-bugs was so high that we never had the capacity to move forward.

Also, some colleagues, people that still stay there, were super toxic. Like, I saw a whole generation of devs leave and every single one of them wanted to avoid working working with this special guy. Same holds for me.

I started looking for a new job at another company.

I managed to switch the team in the meantime, away from the very buggy and toxic environment to a stable, nontoxic environment but also a very old system. The system was Python 2. The oldest commit is 11 years ago. The many generations of devs that worked on this code just added stuff left and right. I found no indication that anyone ever took on technical debt. No documentation, no git commit messages. No CI testing. The single worst code I ever saw. People managed to write even the easiest code in a a weird, most inefficient way. A later colleague once said: "Every line of code here is not right".

Eventually, every single dev from my second team left. They all had issues with management, micromanagement and the super toxic colleagues that, at some point, everyone had encounters with.
We got a new product owner and several new devs. I was 1 month in the team and already the veteran. One of the new guys was what I consider a decent engineer. Logical, practical reasoning, discussing things and assessing options. Two other new guys really disappointed me. Forget coding standards, forget formatting, forget clean git commits or git commit messages. Forget people checking their own code before submitting it. I worked again in a very amateurish team.

I am happy to leave the company and will look back at it as the worst year of my career so far.
