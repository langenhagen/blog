> Class names should reveal intention.


Based on a line in the article https://deniseyu.io/2020/05/23/habits-of-high-performing-teams.html. 
That is, class names should not only be nouns, or even nouns that somehow make sense if you the
system they are part of, they should reveal their intention, as much as possible also for an
outsider.
