I currently read a blog post by Kate Matsudaira at ACM Queue. The blog post has the headline: "The
Evolution of Management - Transitioning up the ladder". Generally - tldr, it's about the importance
of alignment, communication, mentoring, letting go of details and looking into the further future
when climbing up the ladder of management.

Kate wrote one phrase I like to recite:
> Set goals that are continually growing.

Another phrase I identified with:
> Create a culture that places value on doing work that matters and gets the team's goals done, not
> on being the busiest or smartest or loudest person in the room.

I identify with it, because I sometimes feel like one of the busiest people in the room. I really
like doing my work and oftentimes see the necessity and ways to improve on our status quo. Because
of that, I do some extra work.  
I wish to be in an environment that has its foundations nicely laid out and its processes lean
and nicely under control.
