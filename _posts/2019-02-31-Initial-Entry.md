Initial entry. I am happy to have a versioned, easy to maintain markdown blog for public use.
I will use it in my day-to-day work for NDA-compatible things I consider worth sharing with the
public. I will come up with a mechanism to automatically publish the blog several times a day, e.g.
via a cronjob.
